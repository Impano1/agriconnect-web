      <p>In its essence, soil moisture sensors use an electrical current to detect the presence of water in the soil. These sensors then send the information to a computer that displays the results digitally. With technological advancements and the evolution of precision agriculture, current soil moisture sensors have developed in such a way to provide much more than just soil moisture measurements. Theyâ€™re often paired with a comprehensive digital data platform, so users have access to a range of valuable field, crop and weather data. Insights from this data can lead to better decision-making resulting in optimal use of resources, profitable yield and even yield increases.</p>
